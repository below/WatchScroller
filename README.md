# WatchScroller
A sample to illustrate a WatchKit / IB question

#The Question
Why can the green button be scrolled vertically? It is small enough not to need any sort of scrolling.

_IMPORTANT_ This only happens on the device (I tried 42mm). In the simulator (42mm), the button stays as intended

#Thanks
